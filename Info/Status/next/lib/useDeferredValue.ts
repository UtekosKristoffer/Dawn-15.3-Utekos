/**
     * Returns a deferred version of the value that may “lag behind” it.
     *
     * This is commonly used to keep the interface responsive when you have something that renders immediately
     * based on user input and something that needs to wait for a data fetch.
     *
     * A good example of this is a text input.
     *
     * @param value The value that is going to be deferred
     * @param initialValue A value to use during the initial render of a component. If this option is omitted, `useDeferredValue` will not defer during the initial render, because there’s no previous version of `value` that it can render instead.
     *
     * @see {@link https://react.dev/reference/react/useDeferredValue}
